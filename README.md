# fashionable-eatery
This game is a personal development in a competition called Adfaber on Greenfoot path, 
whereby Greenfoot is a genuinely simpler andp more practical library for Java game. The main 
idea behind the game is a two-player 'eating competitions' where you can also get a speed boost.
The task was to be an educational soft, thus there is one more obejective of players is to pay 
attention to which geometric dial is found in the cherry they are picking(assuming the center of
game display has coordinates (0, 0) and thus the map would be split like this:

_____________________________
|             |             |
| the second  |  the first  |
|    dial     |     dial    |
|             |             |
|_____________|_____________|
|             |             |
| the third   | the fourth  |
|    dial     |     dial    |
|             |             |

and if you pick a cherry in the random specified dial you gen triple points for it :)
